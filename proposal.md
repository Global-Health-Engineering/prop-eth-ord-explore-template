# Call Info

## Website

- Measure 1: Calls for Field-Specific Actions
- https://ethrat.ch/en/measure-1-calls-for-field-specific-actions/
- Explore projects will allow early phase exploration, testing and
  prototyping of what an ORD practice could be like. They will enable
  starting to engage with a community without necessarily building up
  something definitive. The aim is to help our researchers to explore if
  ORD practices can be developed and how.

## Aims

Funding for “Explore projects” aims at:

1.  Specifying ORD standards.
2.  Prototyping ORD tools.
3.  Building Communities to engage in ORD practices.
4.  Any other means that help explore and develop ORD practices.

It is important that Explore projects are not self-centred but emphasize
exchanges in the spirit of Open Science with other researchers,
technical experts, and stakeholders.

## Application guidelines (ETH Domain)

- https://ethrat.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Application-Guidelines_TrackA_Explore_2nd_call_FINAL.pdf
- It is the declared goal to fund proposals that make tools (e.g.,
  software; hardware; protocols; standards; benchmarks; documentation
  and training materials; networking and education events, activities
  and resources) available which enable, facilitate and foster sharing
  research data based on ORD principles. Preference will be given to
  projects which engage and are connected to a community. Therefore,
  applicants are strongly invited to demonstrate why their project
  represents an ORD practice that encourages good research in their
  field.
